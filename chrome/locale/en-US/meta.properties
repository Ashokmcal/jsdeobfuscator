# Long description for addons.mozilla.org
description.long=Some websites use various tricks to prevent you from seeing the JavaScript code that runs there, often the code is downloaded from the server in obfuscated form or even generated on the fly. Or maybe the JavaScript codebase is simply too large to browse it easily. Yet the JavaScript engine still needs to know which code to run and that’s where JavaScript Deobfuscator gets its information from: it simply displays the scripts that the JavaScript engine compiles and executes. This makes it a useful tool even when working with web pages that don’t use obfuscation.\n\n<b>How to use JavaScript Deobfuscator</b>\n\nOpen the JavaScript Deobfuscator window from the Web Developer menu. Now it is recording all scripts being compiled or executed. You can open a web page to see what happens while that page loads. Or you can click a button to see what code that click triggers. You can pause recording whenever you need to analyze the results and don’t want new scripts to be added. Press Ctrl+F to open the Find bar and search through the scripts.\n\nNormally, JavaScript Deobfuscator will record all JavaScript code from all tabs. You can use filters to limit it to code originating from a particular website, e.g. specify “http://example.com/” in the “Include scripts” list to only list code from example.com. It is also possible to record JavaScript code executed by Firefox itself, this code is excluded by default however. You can remove some entries from the “Exclude scripts” list to record it as well. <i>Warning</i>: The browser runs lots of code, recording all of it will likely cause it to hang up.\n\n<i>Note</i>: When the JavaScript Deobfuscator window is open all JavaScript code executes much slower. Only open it when you actually need it.\n\n<b>Limitations</b>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Currently no code beautification is being performed beyond what the JavaScript engine does.</li>\n<li>Analyzing websites with lots of JavaScript code such as Gmail can cause the browser to hang.</li>\n<li>For performance reasons filters have to be prefixes of the script locations, the filter strings will only be found at the start of the URL.</li>\n<li>The profiling functionality of JavaScript Deobfuscator is very rudimentary and cannot deal with recursion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Source code / Contributing</b>\n\nThe extension source code is available under https://github.com/palant/jsdeobfuscator.
